A professional web-based planning tool for recreating **Minas Tirith** in Minecraft. Designed for multiplayer coordination, this tool provides layer-by-layer blueprints generated from a procedural geometric model approximating the iconic city.

## Features
- **Procedural Geometry**: Generates the 7 tiers, the Great Prow, and the White Tower dynamically.
- **Layer-by-Layer Slicing**: Slide through Y-levels to see exactly where to place blocks.
- **Material Manifest**: See a realtime count of materials needed for the currently viewed layer.
- **Coordinates & Grid**: Precise coordinate display for accurate block placement.
- **Premium UI**: Modern dark mode interface with smooth controls.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. Use the **Level Y** slider to select the vertical layer you are building.
3. Use the mouse to **Pan** (Click & Drag) and the UI buttons to **Zoom**.
4. Refer to the **Material Manifest** in the sidebar for block counts.

## Inspiration
Based on the architecture of Minas Tirith as seen in *The Lord of the Rings* and popularized in Minecraft by projects like **CraftAttack 13**.
